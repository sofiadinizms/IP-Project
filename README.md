## 1. About the project
- This game consists of the famous Tetris, but with a spin: you are a pirate looking for treasure, and in order to find them you must collect maps and keys that appear randomly on the screen as your tetris pieces fall. If you reach the desired amount of keys and maps, congratulations, that means you found teh treasure! If you lode before reaching those numbers, don't worry, just wait a few seconds and try again! To make this work we used **Python3**  and **Pygame** 

## 2. Code Organization
The project is essencialy divided between the **main.py** file and the **assets** folder. On the main.py you will find the funcions used to make the project actually run, with comments explaining what each one dos exactly. Meanwhile, the asstes folder contains all the assets used in the project
